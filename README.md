# Personal Bio ðŸ‘‹
I am Ruiqian (Richie) Li, [ABD in sociology of religion](https://www.baylor.edu/sociology/index.php?id=953097) at Baylor University and a research associate at [theARDA](https://www.thearda.com/). 
My research interests are in religion and nationalism in the United States, secularization and multiculuturalism, political and sociological thoughts, and of course, data wrangling and visualization.
Fun fact: I am a chubby Asian who lift weights a lot and cultural buddhist.
