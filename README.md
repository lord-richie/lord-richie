# Personal Bio ðŸ‘‹
I am Ruiqian (Richie) Li, Senior Researcher at American University.
My research interests are in religion and nationalism in the United States, secularization and multiculuturalism, political and sociological thoughts, and of course, data wrangling and visualization.
Fun fact: I am a chubby nerd who lift weights and cultural buddhist.
